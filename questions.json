    "introduction": "The most classic interview programming question: FizzBuzz. It's fairly straightforward, but surprisingly tough for even the most well-versed programmers. The challenge is simple: output all integers from 1 to 100 (inclusive), each on a new line. However, if the number is evenly divisible by 3, output \"Fizz\" instead of that number; if it's divisible by 5, output \"Buzz\"; if it's divisible by 3 and 5, output \"FizzBuzz.\" (Note: it's important that your outputs follow PascalCase, where the first letter of each compound word is capitalized; so not \"fizzbuzz,\" but \"FizzBuzz\".)",
